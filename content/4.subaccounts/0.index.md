# SubAccounts

The Subaccounts Protocol for Arweave allows users to create and manage sub-wallets (subaccounts) under a master wallet, with accociation of each sub-wallet with the master wallet in a verifiable manner.

This opens up new possibilities for dApps built on the top of Arweave, as they can have full control over wallet for themselves (which means much better UX, no requirement for user confirmation for actions, more flexibility, etc), while maintaining almost full isolation from main account, resulting in flexible, UX firendly and very secure way of interacting with keys.
